# Simple React Todolist App

This is just a simple todolist app built using [React](https://reactjs.org).
It has no styling. The point was to create and test all the basic functions
a decent todolist app has using only the `useState` React hook.

### Features

Apart from the usual (adding, marking and crossing off tasks as complete) you can:
  - Delete a task whether it is complete or not
  - Show all tasks
  - Hide completed tasks
  - Hide incomplete tasks

### Todo ;)

1. Add basic styling
2. Replace `useState` with `useReducer` and focus on managing more complex
   state scenarios 

### Running locally

1. Clone this github repo: `git clone https://github.com/dekarpaulvictor/Simple-React-Todolist-App.git`
2. Change into the root directory and run `yarn start` or `npm run start`

The app will be served at `http://localhost:3000`
